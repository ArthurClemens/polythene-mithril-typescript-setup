# j2c-plugin-postcss

Use [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) synchronous filters with [j2c](http://j2c.py.gy) v1.x. For server-side usage.

Don't use this on the client side unless you want to bundle PostCSS itself with your app.

## Usage:

```JS
var j2c = require('j2c')
var j2cPostcss = require('j2c-plugin-postcss')
var autoprefixer = j2cPostcss(require('autoprefixer'))

j2c().use(autoprefixer).sheet({
    /* Your nice sheet here */
})
```

## Installation:

```
$ npm install -s j2c-plugin-postcss
```
