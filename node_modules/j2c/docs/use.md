## `j2c().use(plugins)` â€” register plugins

The default `j2c` instance cannot be extended. If you want to use plugins and extensions, you must create a distinct one:

```JS
var _j2c = j2c()
```

Then you can register plugins, using the `use()` method:

```
_j2c.use(require('j2c-prefix'), require('j2c-color'))
```



For most users, that's all you need to know about `.use()`. You can refer to each plugin's documentation for the more details about them.
